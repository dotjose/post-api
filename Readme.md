Sure! Here's a README for your AI-powered blog NestJS API:

# AI-Powered Blog NestJS API

This project is an AI-powered blog API built using NestJS. It leverages MongoDB for data storage, OpenAI for AI functionality, and Pinecone for vector database management.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- [NestJS CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview) (optional but recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or on a cloud service)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/blog
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your-pinecone-environment
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the MongoDB server if it is not already running:

```bash
mongod
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

The API should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Endpoints

Here are some of the main endpoints provided by the API:

- `GET /posts` - Retrieve a list of blog posts
- `GET /posts/:id` - Retrieve a single blog post by ID
- `POST /posts` - Create a new blog post
- `PUT /posts/:id` - Update an existing blog post by ID
- `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete a blog post by ID

### Environment Variables

- `MONGODB_URI`: The URI for connecting to your MongoDB instance.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing OpenAI services.
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing Pinecone services.
- `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: The environment for your Pinecone instance.

### Built With
